# The first 42 college project!
The libft project can be divided into three parts:
* Recoding of some libc functions.
* Coding additional functions.
* Coding bonus functions, if you want more knowledge and of course SCORE!

## Subject
There is a PDF in the subject folder containing details about the project.

## Compiling
Run "make" in the root folder to compile the library. \
Run "make bonus" to compile with the bonus functions. \
Now you can compile the libft.a with your files! 

## Testing
If you want a function description and a simple test: \
Run "make -C tests/" in the root and select the name of the function you want.
