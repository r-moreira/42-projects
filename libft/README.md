```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/r-moreira/42-projects.git

# Enter the project directory
cd libft/

# For the standard lib whithout bonus functions run
make 

# To compile with the bonus functions run
make bonus

# (On progress) If you want a function description and a simple test run: 
make -C tests/
```

Now you can compile the libft.a with your files :)
