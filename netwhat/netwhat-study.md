 - How does routing work with IP◦What is a default gateway for routing
 - What is a port from an IP point of view and what is it used for when connectingto another device

## The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model

### Physical Layer
Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers

### Data Link Layer
Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate.\
The most common Data Link Layer protocol is the Ethernet.
The Ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.

### Network Layer
Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers

### Internetwork
A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet
The most common Internetwork Layer protocol is the IP
IP is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world.

### Transport Layer
Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data
THe most common Transport Layer protocol is the TCP (Transmission Control Protocal), this layer also has the UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### Application Layer
It is the layer through which users interact. This layer has a lot of protocols.

## The Basics of Networking Devices

### Cables
Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them

### Crosstalk
When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire

### Hubs and switches
The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually
referred to as a LAN, or local area network

### Router
A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. Routers share data with each other via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic
